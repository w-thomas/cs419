Name:Outside
LDesc:You are outside of cell block C. It is nearly dusk. There is hardly a breath of wind. It is a pleasant spring evening. For a second, it takes you back to the times you would sit on your front porch with your wife Lori. You quickly snap out of it. Daryl is on the ground 10 feet in front of you. He has a large laceration on his left leg just above his knee. He's losing a lot of blood. To the north is the doorway back leading back into the cell block. To the east is the prison's storage facility. You remind yourself to prop the door open if you go back inside so that there is a little more light in the cell block.
SDesc:You are just beyond the door of cell block C. To the north is the door leading back to the cell block. To the east is the prison's storage facility.
Feature1:Daryl
FeatureDesc:Of all the people in the world, you probably trust Daryl Dixon the most. He's always been there for you. You have saved his life almost as many times and he has saved yours. Daryl has shoulder-length unkept brown hair and a matching goatee. He has steely brown eyes. A man of few words, he speaks with his actions. He wears a black denim sleaveless shirt, blue jeans, and cowboy boots.
Person:True
Interaction:"It's not that bad Rick. I just need a proper tourniquet. There's one in the medkit."
Feature2:wheelbarrow
FeatureDesc:A black wheelbarrow that we found in the storage facility. The tire is nearly worn bald but it saves us a lot of heavy lifting. Hopefully, it lasts long enough to finish the prison garden.
