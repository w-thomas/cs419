Name:Daryl's Cell
LDesc:You are in Daryl's cell. A walker with no legs is trying to drag itself on the floor! Her tattered dress is hooked onto the sink plumbing so she is clawing at the concrete floor stuck in place. She's trying to get to you. If she is able to bite you, you will die and become a walker. How in the hell did she get in the cell block? No time for worrying about that now. You notice the cell block keys on Daryl's cot to the left of the walker. He must have accidentally left them here. You try to reach for them but the walker is too close, snapping her jaw and clawing at the air just inches from your right thigh. To the south is the eastern end of the hallway. It is poorly lit.
